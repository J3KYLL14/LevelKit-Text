# LevelKit-Text

## Prerequisites

This project depends on Qt bindings that are not committed to the repository.
Install the runtime before launching the game:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install PySide6
```

Installing `PySide6` also pulls in its companion package `shiboken6`.

## Running

After installing the dependency, start the template from the repository root:

```bash
python3 levelkit_text/main.py
```

Refer to `levelkit_text/README.md` for guidance on customising rooms, battles,
and assets.
